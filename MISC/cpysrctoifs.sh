# Script name: cpysrctoifs.sh
# Author: Richard Schoen - 
# Parameters: : still dont know how to make it work
# 1.) Desired source member name plus source type extension. Ex: SAMPLE.CLP
#     (You don't need to specify a directory path because it uses current dir)
# 2.) Replace IFS file. N-DO not replace IFS file member, Y-Replace IFS file.
#     (This parm is optional and defaults to Y if not passed.)     
# 
# Purpose: Copy an IBM i library based source member to a corresponding
# IFS work folder based on name only so the file can be edited from the
# IFS directly and then optionally returned to the source member using 
# mbr
#
# IFS directory path must correspond to an actual library/file/member structure.
# Ex source library file: Lib:QGPL File:QCLSRC Member:SAMPLE Type:CLP 
# Ex IFS dir to receive the member for editing: /gitrepos/QGPL/QCLSRC/SAMPLE.CLP
# Ex usage of the ifstombr.sh command:
# Open a bash or other SSH session and change to working directory
# to receive the source member from the library. In this example I am using
# a Git repository path, but you don't have to be using Git in order to user
# this command.
#
# Demo sequence to copy source file member SAMPLE.CLP from QGPL/QCLSRC to IFS
# cd /gitrepos/QGPL/QCLSRC
# srcmbrtoifs.sh SAMPLE.CLP
#
# Result: 
# Source member will be copied from selected library to the IFS folder.
# IFS member will be replaced by default unless you specify NO for replace option
# 
# The beauty of this example is that you can work in Visual Studio Code, Notepad++
# RDI or any editor to edit from the IFS using the SSHFS plugin and you can keep 
# a bash/ssh terminal open to quickly copy a current member from your source library 
# into the IFS for working with. 
#
# Exits:
# 0=Normal - No errors. Source member copy to IFS file was successful
# Non-zero - Errors occuured.
